# DodgeTheDannos
A silly litte game made with Godot for April 3
This game was by following the tutorial here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

Desktop version: https://quietaudience.github.io/DodgeTheDannos/DannypocolypsGame%20V1.1.2.html

I don't own Danny Phantom, nor do I own the artwork used for the player and enemey sprites or the background music
Happy Dannyversary!
