# DodgeTheDannos
A silly litte game made with Godot for the Dannypocolypse.
This game was by following the tutorial here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html
This is where most of the code came from, as well as the music.

I don't own Danny Phantom, nor do I own the artwork used for the player and enemey sprites or the background music
Happy Dannyversary!
